Q.1 Explain Middlewares in NodeJS ?

Ans:In Node.js, middlewares are software components that intercept and
 process incoming requests and outgoing responses. They enhance server
 functionality by adding features, modifying data, handling errors, 
 and performing authentication and authorization tasks. Middlewares 
  are executed sequentially, allowing modular and reusable components 
  to be plugged into the request-response cycle. They promote code 
  organization, reusability, and flexibility in handling server-side logic.

Q.2 Why use Express Over NodeJS ?

Ans:Express is a framework built on top of Node.js that simplifies the development 
of web applications by providing a minimal and flexible set of features. It allows
developers to build web servers and APIs quickly and efficiently, making it a popular
choice for Node.js development.

Q.3 What are REST API ?

REST API (Representational State Transfer API) is an architectural style for designing
networked applications. It is based on a set of principles that define how resources are
 accessed and manipulated over the web. REST APIs use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
  to perform operations on resources, and they typically return data in a format such as JSON or XML.

Q.4 What is the use of MongoDB?

MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database used for storing and retrieving data. It is designed to handle large
amounts of unstructured and semi-structured data, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.
MongoDB's flexible document model allows for easy scalability and data replication across multiple servers
, making it a preferred choice for building modern, high-performance, and scalable applications.

Q.5  What is Mongoose and how does it relate to MongoDB?

Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for Node.js that provides a higher-level abstraction layer
 for interacting with MongoDB. It simplifies the development process by providing a schema-based solution for 
 defining data models, validation rules, and performing database operations. Mongoose integrates with MongoDB 
 and provides additional features like data validation, middleware, query building, and more, making it easier
  to work with MongoDB in a Node.js environment.
